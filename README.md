## Week 1 Challenge

This website is to showcase semantic HTML and introductory CSS properties.

I did this by structuring the "index.html" file with the proper HTML elements and bringing in alternative text for images, as well as adding a few "aria-label" attributes. This highlights web content accessibility and SEO.

I created a number of CSS styles to complete my goal of creating a presentable webpage.
